Hi, I’m Victoria Nduka—a UX Designer who writes, and now exploring the world of cloud engineering.

I’ve worked two years as a UX designer, learning to see technology from the user’s perspective. But, I’m a writer at heart. I found that writing helps me understand complex concepts deeply and communicate them clearly.

Now, I’m channeling that same systematic curiosity toward cloud engineering. I learn by doing. That’s why I’m taking a hands-on approach to learning cloud engineering—building real projects, documenting the challenges I face, and sharing what I learn along the way. This very website is my first project, and I’ve learned a lot about static site hosting, content delivery networks, DNS management, and automated deployments.

Each project I take on serves a dual purpose: deepening my technical understanding while creating content that helps others navigate the same learning journey. I believe that diversity of experience makes for better technologists. UX design showed me the importance of empathy and user-centered thinking. And writing has given me the tools to learn quickly and communicate clearly.

I’m particularly interested in opportunities that combine technical cloud work with writing and education, whether that’s technical documentation, developer advocacy, or creating learning resources that make cloud concepts more accessible.

In my free time, I:

- write poems (though my muse has been suspiciously quiet lately),
- speak passionately about design, accessibility and open source software,
- contribute to open source projects I care about (there seems to be a lot of them)
- or attempt to crochet something - anything - to completion. (Current crochet project status: eternally “almost finished.”)
