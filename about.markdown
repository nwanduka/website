Hi, I’m Victoria Nduka. Depending on the situation, I’m:

- a user experience designer  
- a writer  
- an open source contributor  
- an accessibility advocate  
- a transitioning cloud engineer  
- a speaker  
- a mentor  
- (_insert a new interest here_)

And yes, this is the 17th (ish) iteration of my `About` page.

If you have a role that combines any of these superpowers, feel free to [shoot me a message](mailto:ndukavictoria7@gmail.com) or [connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorianduka). Let’s work together!
