In just a few days, Hacktoberfest 2025 will begin, and so will the scramble to submit pull requests. If you keep up, you could get cool swag out of it. Or a tree planted in your name. All of which are noble. But if you do it right, you could get more out of it—the satisfaction of contributing to a project used by millions, work experience, or maybe even a job.

So, for the many who’ll be participating in Hacktoberfest this year, I have this question: if you’re going to spend an entire month contributing to open source, basically doing volunteer work, wouldn’t you want to make the most of it?

## What is Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an annual, month-long celebration of open source software that takes place every October. It was created by DigitalOcean (in partnership with other sponsors over the years) to encourage participation in open source communities.

Participants typically sign up on the Hacktoberfest website, then contribute to projects by opening pull requests or completing other contribution tasks. In previous years, making a set number of valid contributions (usually 4, but this year the number has increased to 6) could earn you a digital badge or limited-edition swag, like a T-shirt.

## Should I Participate in Hacktoberfest?
If you asked me, I’d immediately say, “Yes, by all means, participate.” But I’ll admit I’m biased, as a strong advocate for open source myself. So, take my advice with a pinch of salt and do your own research. Find out [what open source is](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), and whether it genuinely interests you. Weigh the benefits and downsides for your specific situation.

Some people only gain clarity once they dive in. They discover that they actually enjoy it and find it deeply fulfilling. That could be the case for you too.

## Which Project(s) Should I Contribute to?
You can just pick any repo with a “Hacktoberfest” label and submit PRs, but if you really want to make the most of this month, a little intentionality will go a long way. Consider these points when deciding what project(s) to contribute to:

### Don’t Just Chase the “Good First Issues”
When you’re new, “good first issues” feel like a safe and obvious starting point. And they are, to an extent. But these issues get swarmed fast during Hacktoberfest, and sometimes they’re so trivial that after closing a few, you’re left with no real attachment to the project.

I’m not saying don’t take on good first issues. Actually, do. They’re a good way to start. Test the open source waters. But, beyond that first PR, you should target much deeper issues.

Take time to understand what the project actually does. Does it solve a problem you care about? Do you find yourself curious as you scroll through the README and issues? That spark of curiosity is what will keep you coming back long after October ends.

### Look for Projects with Welcoming Communities
Your experience as a contributor is shaped mostly by the people. A good maintainer or community can make all the difference between feeling like an outsider and feeling like you belong.

Generally, a welcoming project:
- has a clear CONTRIBUTING.md file and a friendly README
- is responsive to issues and PRs
- has active discussion channels (Slack, Discord, mailing lists, etc.)

If you see a lot of stale PRs with no maintainer comments for months, that might be a red flag, or, at least, a sign that your PRs might not get the attention they deserve.

### Align With Your Interests (and Future Goals)
This one’s probably the most important. If you’re hoping to grow your skills or even land opportunities through open source, it makes sense to pick projects that align with where you want to go professionally.

For example, if you’re interested in DevOps or cloud technologies, contributing to [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) projects is a great move. If you’re more into frontend, there are plenty of UI libraries and accessibility-focused projects that welcome contributors.

The point is: don’t pick randomly. Pick intentionally.

## Some CNCF Projects to Explore This Hacktoberfest
I’m diving more deeply into the cloud-native space, so naturally, my recommendations will lean that way. But, CNCF projects are good because many of them are well-maintained, used at scale, and have structured contribution processes. In no particular order, here are a few worth checking out:

- **[OpenTelemetry (OTel)](https://opentelemetry.io/):** I’ve been a contributor for about six months, and I can confirm that the community is very welcoming. You have an opportunity to make a difference if you put your mind to it. [Learn more about the OTel project here](https://opentelemetry.io/community/).
- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/):** If you’re looking to make a mark in the observability space, then consider contributing to Prometheus. One area we need help with is populating the blog with quality content. Check out our [blog content guidelines](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/tree/main/blog#readme) for more information, and [join the community](https://prometheus.io/community/) to find out more ways that you can contribute.
- **[Layer5](https://layer5.io/):** As far as I know, Layer5 has always participated in Hacktoberfest, and this year is no different. In preparation, they’ve [organized an event](https://layer5.io/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2025-designing-with-meshery) to onboard newbies interested in contributing to the project during Hacktoberfest. Layer5 encourages non-code contributions as well. So, if you’re a community manager, digital marketer, or designer, there might be something here for you.
- And a host of others. You can [explore them here](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/).

I’d also add that you shouldn’t pick a project just because it’s popular or has a large community. For example, if your main reason for contributing to Prometheus is that it’s a big-name project and will look good on your résumé, you might want to reevaluate your priorities. That reason alone isn’t necessarily bad, but it becomes a problem when it’s your only motivation. It narrows your perspective and can make you overlook smaller projects that might actually offer more meaningful opportunities for growth and impact. To make sustained contributions and truly grow in a community, your motivation needs to go deeper than prestige.

## Must I Code to Contribute?
This is something I wish more people talked about: open source isn’t just for people who can write code. In fact, some of the most impactful contributors I know rarely touch the codebase. And yes, [Hacktoberfest is open to these kinds of contributions](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#low-or-non-code-contributions).

If you’re not a developer (or even if you are but want to explore other ways to contribute), here are a few meaningful ways to get involved:

### Documentation
Good technical writing is rare. If you can explain complex concepts clearly, write tutorials, or improve API documentation, you're providing huge value. And honestly, documentation contributions are often the fastest path to building relationships with maintainers because you're solving a problem most developers don't enjoy tackling.

### Testing
If you’re good at exploring products and noticing details, becoming a tester or bug reporter is incredibly valuable. Try out new features and report any issues you find. Check if the documentation steps actually work as described. Suggest improvements to the user experience. A well-written bug report is sometimes more helpful than a half-done PR.

### Community & Advocacy
If you’re someone who likes engaging with people, you can contribute in this way too. Help answer questions in community channels or forums. Write blog posts, tutorials, or social media content about the project. Mentor newcomers once you get more familiar with the project. Help organize community events, meetups, or contributor onboarding sessions. These are the kinds of contributions that help a project grow its community and keep it thriving.

### User Experience
It may surprise you just how many open source projects struggle with usability because they're built by and for engineers. If you have UX skills, you could:
- conduct informal accessibility audits and share your findings.
- suggest UX improvements for onboarding flows or interfaces.
- contribute icons, illustrations, or visual assets.

### Translation & Localization
Open source is global. Not everyone reads English comfortably, and translating docs or UI strings into other languages can make a project more accessible to a wider audience. If you speak more than one language, this is a powerful way to make a lasting impact.

## How to Make Contributions that Count
A quick way to set yourself up for failure is to try to contribute to dozens of projects, hunting for easy PRs. That approach might get you swag (with a touch of burnout), but it won't build the relationships or skills that lead anywhere meaningful.

Instead, pick at most two projects. Focus deeply on them. Learn their architecture. Understand their roadmap. Participate in community calls. Build relationships with maintainers. Make contributions that solve real problems, even if they're small problems.

Quality beats quantity every time. One thoughtful, well-implemented contribution that improves the project is worth more than ten trivial typo fixes. Maintainers remember contributors who engage thoughtfully, ask good questions, and take ownership of their work.

### Before October
It might be too late to share this since October is just a few hours away, but better late than never. Don't wait until October 1st to figure out what you're doing. Use the next few days to:
- Research projects that align with your interests
- Join their Slack channels or mailing lists
- Set up your development environment
- Read through the contributing guidelines
- Look at existing issues and PRs to understand what the project needs
- Attend a community meeting if possible

This prep work helps you hit the ground running and shows you're serious about contributing, not just collecting PRs.

### During October
When October arrives, don't just submit PRs and disappear. Engage with the community. Respond to feedback promptly. Help review other contributors' work, if you can. Ask questions that show you're trying to understand, not just complete a task.

Introduce yourself in community channels. Let people know you're participating in Hacktoberfest and interested in staying involved beyond October. Most maintainers appreciate when contributors are upfront about their intentions.

After you submit a PR, follow up on review comments. Be patient with the review process. Maintainers are often volunteers too, juggling open source work with jobs and life.

### After October
This is the part most people get wrong. They grind through October, get their swag, and disappear. All those relationships they built, all that project knowledge they gained—wasted.

If you want this to matter for your career, you need to stay engaged. You don't need to contribute every week, but stay connected. Keep attending community meetings when you can. Continue making contributions at whatever pace is sustainable for you. Help onboard next year's Hacktoberfest participants.

This sustained engagement is what transforms you from "someone who did Hacktoberfest once" to "someone who contributes to Project X." That latter identity opens doors. It builds your reputation and your network.

## What Will You Make of Hacktoberfest 2025?
Hacktoberfest is what you make of it. You can treat it as a month-long scavenger hunt for PRs, or you can use it as a launching pad for sustained involvement in communities that matter to you.
If you're going to spend October contributing to open source anyway, be strategic about it. The swag is nice, but it will fade and wear out eventually. The skills, connections, and opportunities that come from meaningful open source contributions, on the other hand, will still be paying dividends years from now.

So when Hacktoberfest starts in a few days, ask yourself: am I here for the T-shirt, or am I here to build something that lasts?
